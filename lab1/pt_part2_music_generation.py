"""# Lab 1: Intro to PyTorch and Music Generation with RNNs

# Part 2: Music Generation with RNNs

In this portion of the lab, we will explore building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation using PyTorch. We will train a model to learn the patterns in raw sheet music in [ABC notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation) and then use this model to generate new music.

## 2.1 Dependencies
First, let's download the course repository, install dependencies, and import the relevant packages we'll need for this lab.

We will be using [Comet ML](https://www.comet.com/docs/v2/) to track our model development and training runs. First, sign up for a Comet account [at this link](https://www.comet.com/signup?utm_source=mit_dl&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github
) (you can use your Google or Github account). You will need to generate a new personal API Key, which you can find either in the first 'Get Started with Comet' page, under your account settings, or by pressing the '?' in the top right corner and then 'Quickstart Guide'. Enter this API key as the global variable `COMET_API_KEY`.

This will become important soon, when we generate a numerical representation for the text data."""

"""## 2.3 Process the dataset for the learning task

Let's take a step back and consider our prediction task. We're trying to train an RNN model to learn patterns in ABC music, and then use this model to generate (i.e., predict) a new piece of music based on this learned information.

Breaking this down, what we're really asking the model is: given a character, or a sequence of characters, what is the most probable next character? We'll train the model to perform this task.

To achieve this, we will input a sequence of characters to the model, and train the model to predict the output, that is, the following character at each time step. RNNs maintain an internal state that depends on previously seen elements, so information about all characters seen up until a given moment will be taken into account in generating the prediction.

### Vectorize the text

Before we begin training our RNN model, we'll need to create a numerical representation of our text-based dataset. To do this, we'll generate two lookup tables: one that maps characters to numbers, and a second that maps numbers back to characters. Recall that we just identified the unique characters present in the text.
"""

### Define numerical representation of text ###

# Create a mapping from character to unique index.
# For example, to get the index of the character "d",
#   we can evaluate `char2idx["d"]`.
char2idx = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(vocab)}

# Create a mapping from indices to characters. This is
#   the inverse of char2idx and allows us to convert back
#   from unique index to the character in our vocabulary.
idx2char = np.array(vocab)

"""This gives us an integer representation for each character. Observe that the unique characters (i.e., our vocabulary) in the text are mapped as indices from 0 to `len(unique)`. Let's take a peek at this numerical representation of our dataset:"""

print('{')
for char, _ in zip(char2idx, range(20)):
    print('  {:4s}: {:3d},'.format(repr(char), char2idx[char]))
print('  ...\n}')

### Vectorize the songs string ###

'''TODO: Write a function to convert the all songs string to a vectorized
    (i.e., numeric) representation. Use the appropriate mapping
    above to convert from vocab characters to the corresponding indices.

  should be a np.array with `N` elements, where `N` is
  the number of characters in the input string

"""### Create training examples and targets

Our next step is to actually divide the text into example sequences that we'll use during training. Each input sequence that we feed into our RNN will contain `seq_length` characters from the text. We'll also need to define a target sequence for each input sequence, which will be used in training the RNN to predict the next character. For each input, the corresponding target will contain the same length of text, except shifted one character to the right.

To do this, we'll break the text into chunks of `seq_length+1`. Suppose `seq_length` is 4 and our text is "Hello". Then, our input sequence is "Hell" and the target sequence is "ello".

The batch method will then let us convert this stream of character indices to sequences of the desired size.

"""## 2.4 The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model

Now we're ready to define and train an RNN model on our ABC music dataset, and then use that trained model to generate a new song. We'll train our RNN using batches of song snippets from our dataset, which we generated in the previous section.

The model is based off the LSTM architecture, where we use a state vector to maintain information about the temporal relationships between consecutive characters. The final output of the LSTM is then fed into a fully connected linear [`nn.Linear`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) layer where we'll output a softmax over each character in the vocabulary, and then sample from this distribution to predict the next character.

As we introduced in the first portion of this lab, we'll be using PyTorch's [`nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html) to define the model. Three components are used to define the model:

* [`nn.Embedding`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Embedding.html): This is the input layer, consisting of a trainable lookup table that maps the numbers of each character to a vector with `embedding_dim` dimensions.
* [`nn.LSTM`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html): Our LSTM network, with size `hidden_size`.
* [`nn.Linear`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html): The output layer, with `vocab_size` outputs.

To train our model on this classification task, we can use a form of the `crossentropy` loss (i.e., negative log likelihood loss). Specifically, we will use PyTorch's [`CrossEntropyLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html), as it combines the application of a log-softmax ([`LogSoftmax`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LogSoftmax.html#torch.nn.LogSoftmax)) and negative log-likelihood ([`NLLLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.NLLLoss.html#torch.nn.NLLLoss) in a single class and accepts integer targets for categorical classification tasks.

"""## 2.6 Generate music using the RNN model

Now, we can use our trained RNN model to generate some music! When generating music, we'll have to feed the model some sort of seed to get it started (because it can't predict anything without something to start with!).

Once we have a generated seed, we can then iteratively predict each successive character (remember, we are using the ABC representation for our music) using our trained RNN. More specifically, recall that our RNN outputs a `softmax` over possible successive characters. For inference, we iteratively sample from these distributions, and then use our samples to encode a generated song in the ABC format.

Then, all we have to do is write it to a file and listen!

### The prediction procedure

Now, we're ready to write the code to generate text in the ABC music format:

* Initialize a "seed" start string and the RNN state, and set the number of characters we want to generate.

* Use the start string and the RNN state to obtain the probability distribution over the next predicted character.

* Sample from multinomial distribution to calculate the index of the predicted character. This predicted character is then used as the next input to the model.

* At each time step, the updated RNN state is fed back into the model, so that it now has more context in making the next prediction. After predicting the next character, the updated RNN states are again fed back into the model, which is how it learns sequence dependencies in the data, as it gets more information from the previous predictions.

![LSTM inference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MITDeepLearning/introtodeeplearning/2019/lab1/img/lstm_inference.png)

"""### Play back the generated music!

We can now call a function to convert the ABC format text to an audio file, and then play that back to check out our generated music! Try training longer if the resulting song is not long enough, or re-generating the song!

We will save the song to Comet -- you will be able to find your songs under the `Audio` and `Assets & Artifacts` pages in your Comet interface for the project. Note the [`log_asset()`](https://www.comet.com/docs/v2/api-and-sdk/python-sdk/reference/Experiment/#experimentlog_asset) documentation, where you will see how to specify file names and other parameters for saving your assets.

"""## 2.7 Experiment and **get awarded for the best songs**!

Congrats on making your first sequence model in TensorFlow! It's a pretty big accomplishment, and hopefully you have some sweet tunes to show for it.

Consider how you may improve your model and what seems to be most important in terms of performance. Here are some ideas to get you started:

*  How does the number of training epochs affect the performance?
*  What if you alter or augment the dataset?
*  Does the choice of start string significantly affect the result?

Try to optimize your model and submit your best song! **Participants will be eligible for prizes during the January 2025 offering. To enter the competition, you must upload the following to [this submission link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/U8nND6enGjirujVZKX1n):**

* a recording of your song;
* iPython notebook with the code you used to generate the song;
* a description and/or diagram of the architecture and hyperparameters you used -- if there are any additional or interesting modifications you made to the template code, please include these in your description.

**Name your file in the following format: ``[FirstName]_[LastName]_RNNMusic``, followed by the file format (.zip, .mp4, .ipynb, .pdf, etc). ZIP files of all three components are preferred over individual files. If you submit individual files, you must name the individual files according to the above nomenclature.**

You can also tweet us at [@MITDeepLearning](https://twitter.com/MITDeepLearning) a copy of the song (but this will not enter you into the competition)! See this example song generated by a previous student (credit Ana Heart): <a href="https://twitter.com/AnaWhatever16/status/1263092914680410112?s=20">song from May 20, 2020.</a>

Have fun and happy listening!
