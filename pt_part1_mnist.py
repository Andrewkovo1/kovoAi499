In the first portion of this lab, we will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of handwritten digits from the famous [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.

"""## 1.2 Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Classification

We'll first build a simple neural network consisting of two fully connected layers and apply this to the digit classification task. Our network will ultimately output a probability distribution over the 10 digit classes (0-9). This first architecture we will be building is depicted below:

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MITDeepLearning/introtodeeplearning/master/lab2/img/mnist_2layers_arch.png "CNN Architecture for MNIST Classification")

### Fully connected neural network architecture
To define the architecture of this first fully connected neural network, we'll once again use the the `torch.nn` modules, defining the model using [`nn.Sequential`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html). Note how we first use a [`nn.Flatten`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Flatten) layer, which flattens the input so that it can be fed into the model.

In this next block, you'll define the fully connected layers of this simple network.
"""

    fc_model = nn.Sequential(
        # First define a Flatten layer
        nn.Flatten(),

        # '''TODO: Define the activation function for the first fully connected (Dense/Linear) layer.'''
        nn.Linear(28 * 28, 128),

        nn.ReLU(),


        nn.Linear(128, 10)
        )
    return fc_model

fc_model_sequential = build_fc_model()

"""As we progress through this next portion, you may find that you'll want to make changes to the architecture defined above. **Note that in order to update the model later on, you'll need to re-run the above cell to re-initialize the model.**

Let's take a step back and think about the network we've just created. The first layer in this network, `nn.Flatten`, transforms the format of the images from a 2d-array (28 x 28 pixels), to a 1d-array of 28 * 28 = 784 pixels. You can think of this layer as unstacking rows of pixels in the image and lining them up. There are no learned parameters in this layer; it only reformats the data.

After the pixels are flattened, the network consists of a sequence of two `nn.Linear` layers. These are fully-connected neural layers. The first `nn.Linear` layer has 128 nodes (or neurons). The second (and last) layer (which you've defined!) should return an array of probability scores that sum to 1. Each node contains a score that indicates the probability that the current image belongs to one of the handwritten digit classes.

That defines our fully connected model!

### Embracing subclassing in PyTorch

Recall that in Lab 1, we explored creating more flexible models by subclassing [`nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html). This technique of defining models is more commonly used in PyTorch. We will practice using this approach of subclassing to define our models for the rest of the lab.

"""### Model Metrics and Training Parameters

Before training the model, we need to define components that govern its performance and guide its learning process. These include the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics:

* *Loss function* — This defines how we measure how accurate the model is during training. As was covered in lecture, during training we want to minimize this function, which will "steer" the model in the right direction.
* *Optimizer* — This defines how the model is updated based on the data it sees and its loss function.
* *Metrics* — Here we can define metrics that we want to use to monitor the training and testing steps. In this example, we'll define and take a look at the *accuracy*, the fraction of the images that are correctly classified.

We'll start out by using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer initialized with a learning rate of 0.1. Since we are performing a categorical classification task, we'll want to use the [cross entropy loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html).

You'll want to experiment with both the choice of optimizer and learning rate and evaluate how these affect the accuracy of the trained model.
"""

# Define loss function and optimizer
loss_function = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(fc_model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

"""### Train the model

We're now ready to train our model, which will involve feeding the training data (`train_dataset`) into the model, and then asking it to learn the associations between images and labels. We'll also need to define the batch size and the number of epochs, or iterations over the MNIST dataset, to use during training. This dataset consists of a (image, label) tuples that we will iteratively access in batches.

In Lab 1, we saw how we can use the [`.backward()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.backward.html) method to optimize losses and train models with stochastic gradient descent. In this section, we will define a function to train the model using `.backward()` and `optimizer.step()` to automatically update our model parameters (weights and biases) as we saw in Lab 1.

Recall, we mentioned in Section 1.1 that the MNIST dataset can be accessed iteratively in batches. Here, we will define a PyTorch [`DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) that will enable us to do that.

### Evaluate accuracy on the test dataset

Now that we've trained the model, we can ask it to make predictions about a test set that it hasn't seen before. In this example, iterating over the `testset_loader` allows us to access our test images and test labels. And to evaluate accuracy, we can check to see if the model's predictions match the labels from this loader.

## 1.3 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit classification

As we saw in lecture, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are particularly well-suited for a variety of tasks in computer vision, and have achieved near-perfect accuracies on the MNIST dataset. We will now build a CNN composed of two convolutional layers and pooling layers, followed by two fully connected layers, and ultimately output a probability distribution over the 10 digit classes (0-9). The CNN we will be building is depicted below:

### Define the CNN model

We'll use the same training and test datasets as before, and proceed similarly as our fully connected network to define and train our new CNN model. To do this we will explore two layers we have not encountered before: you can use  [`nn.Conv2d`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html) to define convolutional layers and [`nn.MaxPool2D`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MaxPool2d.html) to define the pooling layers. Use the parameters shown in the network architecture above to define these layers and build the CNN model. You can decide to use `nn.Sequential` or to subclass `nn.Module`based on your preference.

"""## 1.5 Conclusion
In this part of the lab, you had the chance to play with different MNIST classifiers with different architectures (fully-connected layers only, CNN), and experiment with how different hyperparameters affect accuracy (learning rate, etc.). The next part of the lab explores another application of CNNs, facial detection, and some drawbacks of AI systems in real world applications, like issues of bias.
